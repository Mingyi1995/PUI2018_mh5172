## Perceived Safety Score and Violence 
### extra credit project

### Abstract 

The visual appearance of urban streets has a strong connection to citizens’ behavior. People’s feeling about the outdoor environment is hard to measure and predict. Moreover, the feeling is not equal to fact. In this paper, I used linear regression method to analysis whether the perceived safety score from citizens reflects the real crime amount. In this case, I failed to find any statistically significant relationship between the perceived safety score and violence related crimes.
