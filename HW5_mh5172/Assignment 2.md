# Assignment 2: Literature choices of statistical tests

Worked with Chand Du(cd2682) and Xiaoning He(xh1163). I finished the Logistic Regression.

Correlation | 7, age, gender, self-reported honesty, self-reported popularity, self-reported intelligence, class level, block | categorical | 1, cheating behaviors | ordinal | 1, test difficulty | ordinal | How strongly and in what direction are demographics (age, gender), self-perception(self-reported honesty, self-reported popularity, self-reported intelligence), environmental factors(class level, block) related with cheating behavior. | Depends on which IV is tested: take gender for example: (women's score of experimental group/ women's score of control group) > (men's score of experimental group/ men's score of control group) | 0.05 | [Behavioral correlates of cheating: Environmental specificity and reward expectation](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0186054) |
